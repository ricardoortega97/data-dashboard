## Notes

- Setting the api data to display in a table list while moving the information to a component.
- Trying to understand how the API calls and the reference as each JSON is different than others. 
- Limited by 5 API calls a minute made it hard to understand how the API calls work as the beginning, the function was calling it multiple times. 
- Finding an API to use for the project as the first one was to do a Salary API from the BLS.
